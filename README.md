A curated collection of small front-end clone projects built with **HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap** for learning and practice.  
These projects focus on replicating the **layout and structure** of real-world websites, serving as exercises in front-end development.

## 🎯 Purpose
The goal of this repository is to improve front-end skills by building simple, static website clones.
